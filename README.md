# geoevent-timetree-processor
Processor for GeoEvent that creates timelines from historic geoevent point locations.  The number of events can be determined by a simple count (e.g. the last 5 points) or a time range (e.g. the last 10 minutes).

The processor is intended to utilize a relatively small number of points and is not intended for large caches of data.

BETA: This processor has not been tested/evaluated for performance and should be considered non-production at this time.
